                <h4>About the Internship</h4>
                <p class="indent text-justify">
                  Being a part of Siemens was indeed a great opportunity and my best career experience so far. Joining such a
                  corporate size company was difficult at first, considering that It was my first experience in the field
                  outside class room and freelancing. I have joined one of the <b>SCRUM teams</b>,
                  which worked on the <b>Central Image Processing (CIP)</b>
                  module of application called <b>Syngo.via</b>. Since Syngo via was running on <b>.NET</b> framework, I had a change to
                  apply skills, which I have acquared from my previous projects.
                </p>

            <!--Row1 -->
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-xs-12 mg-sm-top">
                <h4>Responsibilities and Tasks</h4>
                <p class="indent text-justify">
                  One of the pros of my internship was that my tasks changed based on my knowledge and experience with the application.
                  I began with writing <b>Unit tests</b> using <b>Moq</b> library. My task was to improve test coverage, preferably of classes
                  with higher defect occurences. I have quickly learned about the importance of <b>testable architecture</b> and design,
                  because I was not able to properly test some part of the poorly written / legacy code.
                </p>
                <p class="indent text-justify">
                  Later I started to write <b>automated tests</b>. I was focusing on this during the majority of the internship, since automated UI tests
                  were crutial for such front-end heavy application. I was given the <b>manual test specification</b> as well as the <b>requirement specification</b>
                  and my task was to write tests for features that have not yet been tested. The automation took advantage of the command pattern
                  and set of test steps. The key point was to write the tests <b>fluently</b>, so that they resemble the manual test specification
                  as much as possible. I have applied the knowledge of automation in my later projects - Spots and Georgia tech library.
                </p>
                <p class="indent text-justify">
                  I was also part of <b>manual testing</b> that the whole team participated upon after every small release. The team would slip the manual
                  test specification and collectevely test the part of the system its responsible for. If any defects were found, they were documented
                  and later verified by the <b>product owner</b>.
                </p>
                <p class="indent text-justify">
                  Finally, I was also working on improvment of the <b>automated test step library</b>. Some features to be tested required test steps that were
                  not supported, so I was to implement them.

                <h4>What is Spots?</h4>
                <p>
                  Spots in a nutshell is a centrilized booking system. It is designed to help users to manager their meetings, events
                  and time overall. A large part of the system also focuses on communication - users are able to interact,
                  create meetings together as well as to see who is available and when.
                  The application helps users to find a perfect spot for their meetings - whether it is a table at the restaurant or a
                  classroom for university team meeting.
                  The company was created as a part of my internship at UCN's next step.

                <h4>Technologies behind spots</h4>
                <p>
                  Spots was developed as a web application, using ASP.Net MVC and C#. When it comes to databases, we have chose different databases
                  for different purposes - SQL server was used for authentication and NoSQL database mongoDB was used to handle both information
                  about the users, spots, locations and events as well as exception and activity logs.</br>
                  On the client side, Knockout JS and MVVM pattern was used, together with bootstrap and jquery.

                <h4>Technical outcome</h4>
                <p>
                  From the technological stand point, I have learned
                  a lot about MVC architecture and I have strenghten my knowledge in C#, Object oriented programming, Design pattern and I have
                  generally improved the quality of my code. The biggest value was that the project has much longer lifespan that other university
                  projects I have done. This really taught me the importance of writing clean, testable code according to the SOLID principles.
